Each subdirectory (folder) within this collection specifies the license for the files within that folder (and all subfolders where a LICENSE file does not exist).

As a guideline, everything except Presto <emphasis>probably</emphasis> uses an Apache license, but <strong>Presto (proper) uses a GNU license.</strong>

<strong>Files that are Apache-licensed must never, ever require modules (files) that are GNU-licensed.  Ever.</strong>

One day, I plan to split into multiple collections (perhaps just two) based on licensing.
