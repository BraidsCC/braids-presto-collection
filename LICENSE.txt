Each subdirectory (folder) within this collection specifies the license for the files within that folder (and all subfolders where a LICENSE file does not exist).

As a guideline, everything except Presto *probably* uses an Apache license, but Presto uses a GNU license.

Files that are Apache-licensed must never, ever require modules (files) that are GNU-licensed.  Ever.

One day, I plan to split presto into its own collection.
